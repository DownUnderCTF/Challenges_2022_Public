**Difficulty**: Easy

**Author**: Cake#4096 & Conletz#5420

Solving this challenge will unlock more "Shop- " challenges in the DFIR category.

All the "Shop- " challenges in the DFIR category use the same JSON data set (`DownUnderShop.JSON`) which can be downloaded from here. 

We'd encourage you to use a log analytics tool such as Splunk (1 week free cloud trial) to assist with analysing the logs. 

These logs and scenarios are designed to be real-ish, they're simpler and given that the entire data set covers 1hr all malicious activity is conducted on a condensed time frame. 

The structure of the fake website being targeted is a basic online store with browsing, purchasing and account functionality. 

Flag formats will not be in the standard `DUCTF{}` format, as an example the flag for this challenge is `IAgreeToTheTeasAndTheSeas`

Feedback is very highly encouraged.
